Airline Reservation System, beta program
It uses a custom mysql database to reserve aeroplane tickets
Note that this ticket is dummy and won't work for actual reservation.

* To use it make sure to add your database details in the index file of models
* Adding routes and mailing system
* Note that to make the mailing system work trace the passenger.js and payment.js and make changes in transporter and mail options(you will find mail options inside sql queries).


## Ignore any mistakes as we are new to coding and the project has heavy backend. Feel free to mail us about the bugs or leave a comment. Thank You!!!
